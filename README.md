# Programming_for_DA
Repository for ProgDA Assignment - Semester 2 - 2020


This notebook breaks down the Numpy.random package in Python, and explains its many benefits in the data analytics, data science and machine learning worlds. Data is everywhere around us, and the ability to analyse data has never been more valuable, or important. 

The random module in numpy enables the creation of data arrays, amoung many other operations. Specific topics covered in this repository include explaining the overall purpose of the package, explaining the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions, explaining the use and purpose of “Distributions” functions, and explaining the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. Many of the topics covered in the repository are technical, therefore thorough research was required. 



### Issues Faced During This Project


Like any project there were some issues faced, and lessons learned for future work. Problems with different files being pushed to the main and master branch on github, made it difficult to gather all essentials files in the one branch without comprimising the git history. In the end the use of git pull and merge was determined as the best way of solving the problem. 


The second issue faced was trying to put technical terms into my own words, or rewording mathematical explanations. To deal with this issue I explained all terminology possible in my own words, and where this was not possible, citations were used. 


The final problem faced was the rearranging of structure of the jupyter notebook when it was pushed to github. Many headings in the notebook did not appear when opened on github. The notebook was edited to allow for certain structural problems, where possible. 



Overall this assesment was extremely benficial for my development as a data analyst. Through extensive research and consistent work and commits, I believe I have developed a much greater overall understanding of the Numpy Random package.
